This project is a simple yet functional Python script designed for email-based OTP (One-Time Password) verification. It utilizes Python's built-in smtplib for sending emails via the Gmail SMTP server and the email.mime modules (MIMEMultipart and MIMEText) for formatting the message content. When executed, the script generates a random 4-digit OTP using the random module and sends it to a user-specified email address entered through the command line. The message body contains the OTP and is sent from a predefined sender email (configured within the script). Once the email is sent, the script prompts the user to enter the OTP they received. The input is then compared against the original generated OTP to determine whether the verification is successful.This script is especially useful as a foundational example for developers learning how to integrate basic email authentication into applications or web services. It demonstrates secure email transmission through starttls() and login authentication using an app-specific password (necessary for Gmail accounts with two-factor authentication enabled). Before using the script, users must replace the placeholder sender email address and app password with their own credentials. Note that for Gmail to allow access, you must enable "App Passwords" in your Google Account security settings. This approach avoids exposing your primary password and maintains better security compliance.Although simple, this script can be extended for use in larger applications such as user registration flows, password reset systems, or multi-factor authentication setups. For production environments, consider adding more advanced features such as rate limiting, OTP expiration, encrypted configuration, and error handling.
